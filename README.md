#  Positivus Landing Page 

This project is a responsive landing page developed by converting the **Positivus** Figma design into clean, semantic HTML and CSS. The implementation closely follows the original mockup, delivering a pixel-perfect and responsive user experience.

> 🎨 **Design Credit:** The original Figma design was created by [olga](https://www.figma.com/@olgaaverchenko) on Figma Community.
